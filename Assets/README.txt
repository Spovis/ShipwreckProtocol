Anything you create specifically for your features should be placed in the directory with your name, under the "Assets/TeamMembers" folder. We are not allowed to modify any code relating to another person's feature, so this is important.

I highly recommend writing some kind of documentation or at least heavily commenting your code. It will make it easier if someone needs to create a reference to something from your feature.
