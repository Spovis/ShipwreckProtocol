    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
      <p>This prefab includes a 2d alien boss that can be used in your game.</p>
      <p>The boss has an internal state machine which allows it to move between the following states:</p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p><span class="bold">Idle</span>: the boss will remain stationary with an idle animation.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Take Damage</span>: the boss will decrease it's internal health by 10 and play a damage animation, flashing red.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Die</span>: when the boss's health reaches 0, it will die and play a death animation. Once the animation has finished, it  will remove itself from the scene.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Attack</span>: The attack state will trigger the boss to play a particular animation, and launch 4 fireballs across the screen to cause damage to the player.</p>
      </div>
      <p>This will allow you instantly add a boss to your 2d game. The included C# code is simple and easy to use. It is also highly modular, allowing you to customize the code to your exact needs easily.</p>
